# CEN3031G28 IT Ticket Help Desk App
Welcome to our IT Ticket Help Desk Project. This project was created for UF's Summer Semester's Intro To Software Engineering Course.

# Prerequisites

### NPM

Make sure you have npm installed before running the application. If you do not have it, you can do the following:

1. Visit the [installer page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Download the relevant version and run the file. (Recommend using the Prebuilt Installer if you are unfamiliar with CLI)

### Git

Make sure you have Git installed as it is how we interact with repositories on Github. If you do not have it, you can do the following:

1. Visit the Git [download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Choose your corresponding operating system. (ie: Windows)
3. Choose the standalone installer if on Windows. (You probably know what to do if on other OS's)

## How to Run the Project
1. Get the project. Fork the repository by interacting with the 'Fork' button at the top right of the page. This will copy the repository into your account. 

2. Once you have forked the repository, go into this forked repository and click on the code button and copy the git url.

3. Clone the project into your system:
```
git clone <git url>
```

4. Access the corresponding directories and run 'npm install' to install the corresponding dependencies (we recommend using two terminals for this) 

-  Terminal 1:
```
cd CEN3031G28/server
npm install
```

- Terminal 2:
```
cd CEN3031G28/client
npm install
```

5. Run npm start in each terminal to start the APP's frontend and backend. Launch the app in a webpage by following the link provided in Terminal 2.

- Terminal 1:
```
npm start
```

- Terminal 2:
```
npm start
```

You should now successfully have a running project to interact with.
